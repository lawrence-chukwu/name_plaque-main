Do something when the user clicks the buy now button. If the user has not entered anything, a message will appear telling them to enter a name.

If a word has been entered, let the user know if the count is available.

1. Create a new javascript file called **`buy_now.js`**  (you will be working inside this file).
2. Create an arrow function called `**buyNow**`
3. In the function, check if the input field is empty; if it is, print a message asking the user to input letters.
4. In the function, check if the input field value is equal to the default text (eg: `**input === ‘YOUR NAME’**`) , if it is; print a message asking the user to enter their custom letters.
5. Print a success message if the user enters a unique letter.
6. If letter length is greater than 15, tell the user that they exceeded the number of available letters.
7. Finally, set a `**click**` event for the buy now button  by also calling the **`buyNow`** function.
